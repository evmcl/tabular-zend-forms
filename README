Tabular Zend Forms

https://github.com/evmcl/tabular-zend-forms

This is some code to allow you to produce Zend Forms that use tables for laying
out their elements.

The Ev folder contains the code that you need to stick in your PHP include
path.

Example.php is an example of a function producing a tabular form.  It it well
commented.

Example_Result.html is a sample HTML file displaying the form markup that is
produced by the code in Example.php (although I pretty formatted it).

In particular, pay attention to the classes given to various parts of the form,
and how they can be used to style the form a bit.

This code has been used with Zend Framework 1.5.1.  Don't know if it'll work on
newer versions.

The Zend Framework is found at http://framework.zend.com/
